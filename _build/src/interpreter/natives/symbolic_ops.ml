    symbolic_ops.ml

    Defines methods for dealing with symbolic rvectors.

    This file includes symbolic arithmetic, as well as other functions that
    are used to combine symbolic vectors, like concatenation, conversion
    from concrete values, etc. For now, a symbolic combine should assume that
    inputs are correct. That is, division by zero should add a path constraint
    that the values of the denominator are all nonzero. Another paradigm for
    dealing with this is to produce a "good" state with these assumptions, and
    an error state with the negation of them, but we are less interested in
    checking for unsatisfiability of error states and more about proofs
    over valid inputs for now, so the first approach is better.
   
    A note about symbolic vectors:
    The way that we handle symbolic vectors is somewhat complicated.
    To output Smt2Lib code, we need to produce a list at the end of every
    symbolic value. To do this, the state keeps a list of every symbolic 
    value in the heap. Symbolic values are never deallocated because a new
    symbolic vector's definition may depend on an old symbolic value.
    The state_alloc function which allocates new memory also ensures that if
    the object you're allocating is symbolic, it is registered as such.

    What about "implicit" symbolic vectors, though? The most common case where
    this comes up is in an operation like x + 3. For us, we implicitly coerce
    the vector 3 to a symbolic vector which is constrained to have the same
    values, length, type, etc. Then, we do a symbolic addition between these
    vectors, and get back a definition for a new symbolic vector. This
    definition relies on the (already allocated) x, and the (unallocated)
    symbolic 3. Instead of requiring that the function that created sym3 also
    be responsible for allocating it, symbolic vectors come with a dependency
    list of vector definitions. When creating a symbolic vector, there are
    two choices: make a true S.rvector, in which case that vector must be
    allocated, or leave it as an S.symvec, in which case it must appear inside
    the dependencies of an allocated vector.
    This scheme is complex, but it reduces the possibility of writing code that
    accidentally creates symbolic values and never allocates them. This is
    because there is an explicit type difference between the kind of symbolic
    vector which can (and must) be allocated, and the kind of symbolic vector
    which is implicit and should be a dependency for some allocated vector.

    That's why the functions in this file produce symvecs or symdefs;
    the actual native call is where the logic is that decides which
    vectors to allocate.
